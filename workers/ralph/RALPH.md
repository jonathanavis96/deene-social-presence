# Ralph Wiggum - Iterative Loop Runner

Ralph is a systematic, iterative development loop that alternates between planning and building phases.

## The Ralph Contract

### Phase 0: Initial Study (Before First Iteration)

**0a. Study THOUGHTS.md**  
Use parallel subagents (max 100) to read project vision, goals, and success criteria. Create minimal THOUGHTS.md if missing.

**0b. Identify source code location**  
Prefer `src/` directory. If different, document the actual location.

**0c. Study workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**  
Read the current plan. If it doesn't exist or is empty, the first iteration must create it.

### The Loop

Ralph operates in two alternating phases:

#### 📋 PLAN Phase

See `PROMPT.md` (planning mode section) for full instructions.

**Goal**: Create or update `workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with clear, atomic tasks

**Frequency**:

- First iteration (if workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md missing/empty)
- Every N iterations (configurable, default: every 3)
- When explicitly requested

#### 🔨 BUILD Phase

See `PROMPT.md` (building mode section) for full instructions.

**Goal**: Implement the top item from `workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Process**:

1. Take top incomplete item from workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Implement the change
3. Run build/tests
4. Update workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (mark completed `[x]`)
5. Append progress to workers/ralph/THUNK.md
6. Stage changes with `git add -A` (NO commit - loop.sh batches commits at PLAN phase)

### Parallelism Contract

**Reading/Searching** (max 100 parallel subagents):

- Studying specs, source code, documentation
- Searching for patterns, imports, references
- Analyzing KB files and best practices

**Building/Testing** (exactly 1 agent):

- Running build commands
- Executing tests and benchmarks
- Making file modifications
- Git operations (staging in BUILD, commits batched at PLAN phase)

### Completion Sentinel

When all work is complete, Ralph outputs:

```text
:::COMPLETE:::
```text

The loop runner detects this sentinel and stops iteration.

## Progress Tracking

All Ralph task completions are logged to `workers/ralph/THUNK.md` with:

- Task ID
- Timestamp
- Phase (PLAN or BUILD)
- Actions taken
- Results and outcomes

Organized into "eras" for major project phases.

## Git Commits

**Commits are batched at PLAN phase** for efficiency (~13 seconds saved per BUILD iteration).

**BUILD phase:** Stage changes only (`git add -A`, no commit)  
**PLAN phase:** loop.sh commits all accumulated BUILD changes at PLAN start, then stages/commits plan updates

**Exception:** Verifier failures get immediate commits in BUILD mode with message: `fix(ralph): resolve AC failure <RULE_ID>`

This ensures:

- Fewer, more meaningful commits
- Faster BUILD iterations (no commit overhead)
- Comprehensive commit messages (Ralph has full context during PLAN)
- All related changes grouped together

## Knowledge Base Integration

Ralph can consult project-specific skills in the skills directory when it exists.

**Knowledge growth:**
When Ralph discovers new conventions or decisions specific to the project, it can create/update KB files in the skills directory.

## Running Ralph

### PowerShell

```powershell
.\workers\ralph\ralph.ps1 -Iterations 10 -PlanEvery 3
```text

### Manual (RovoDev CLI)

```powershell
# Ralph determines mode from iteration number
acli rovodev run "$(Get-Content workers\ralph\PROMPT.md -Raw)"
```text

## File Structure

```text

├── src/                    # Source code - ALWAYS in project root!

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Source code goes in PROJECT ROOT, not Ralph directory

**The Ralph directory contains Ralph loop infrastructure AND project context files.**

- Source code → `src/` (project root)
- Config files → project root (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.)
- Entry points → project root (`index.html`, `main.py`, etc.)
- Ralph files → Ralph directory (PROMPT.md, AGENTS.md, THOUGHTS.md, NEURONS.md, THUNK.md, skills/, logs/, etc.)
- Task tracking → workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (one level up from ralph/)

**NEVER put application code inside the Ralph directory.**

## Philosophy: Ralph Wiggum

Named after the Simpsons character who famously said "I'm helping!" Ralph embodies:

- **Simple and obvious** - No clever tricks, just systematic iteration
- **Persistent** - Keeps going until the job is done
- **Honest** - Logs everything, admits what it doesn't know
- **Helpful** - Focused on making progress, not being perfect

Ralph doesn't try to be smart. Ralph just follows the contract and gets the work done.
